## Overview

Decentralized Book Manager is a cross-platform application that allows users to manage their book collection in a decentralized manner. It leverages blockchain technology and decentralized storage to ensure that user data is secure and owned by the user.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, edit, and delete book records.
- **User Management**: Handle multiple user profiles.
- **Journal**: Maintain a reading journal for each book.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Use IPFS or similar technologies to store book data.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on Web, Mobile, and Desktop platforms.
